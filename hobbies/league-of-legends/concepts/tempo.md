Tempo is the **pace at which the game plays out**, dictating which team should **act** and which team should **respond**. It is what makes _League of Legends_, despite being a real-time game, fundamentally operate like a **turn-based strategy** — where every action forces a reaction.

[How to Identify Tempo Advantage](#How%20to%20Identify%20Tempo%20Advantage)

This quote captures the essence of tempo: it is about **recognizing and creating opportunities** rather than simply waiting for them. The best players don't just react to the game; they control its flow, forcing the enemy into **disadvantageous situations** while maintaining their own ability to act.

## How to Identify Tempo Advantage

As a general rule, the team with **tempo advantage** is the one that:

- Has the **most gold actively spent** (resetting and purchasing items before the enemy).
- Has **waves pushed** into the enemy's side of the map, forcing them to respond.
- Has **vision control**, enabling them to dictate when and where plays happen.

Tempo isn't just about moving fast — it's about making sure **your actions are meaningful** while forcing your opponent to play on your terms.
