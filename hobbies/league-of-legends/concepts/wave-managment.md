Wave management refers to the strategic manipulation of minion waves to gain an advantage over your opponent. By carefully managing how minions are positioned on the lane, you can create opportunities for ganks, objectives, or vision control.

### **Types of Wave States**

#### **Fast Pushing (Shoving the Wave)**

Fast pushing the wave means intentionally causing your minions to move toward the enemy tower. This creates **pressure on the enemy**, forcing them to react. When you push the wave, the opponent must:

- **Clear the wave**, which gives you time to **roam, take objectives, or invade** while they are occupied.
- **Farm under turret**, where they may **lose last hits** or take **harassment** from poke champions.

Pushing is useful when you want to reset, pressure an objective, or set up a roam. However, if done incorrectly, it can leave you vulnerable to **ganks** from the enemy jungler or to the enemy **freezing your wave**.

#### **Freezing (Holding the Wave in Place)**

A **freeze** is when you keep the minion wave **near your tower** without letting it reach your turret. This is done by last-hitting minions only when necessary to **maintain the waveâ€™s position**. When you freeze:

- You **deny your opponent farm and experience**, as they must overextend to last-hit safely.
- You create **opportunities for ganks**, since the enemy is forced into a dangerous position to farm.
- You **stay safe from ganks**, as the enemy jungler has little room to engage on you.

Freezing is a powerful tool when **playing from behind**, as it forces the enemy to come closer to your side of the map, making them **easier to punish**.

#### **Slow Pushing (Building a Stacked Wave)**

A **slow push** happens when you build up a **large wave** that gradually moves toward the enemy turret. This is done by **last-hitting minions slowly**, allowing your own minions to accumulate. A slow push gives you:

- **Time to roam, take objectives, or set up vision** while the wave builds up.
- A **stacked wave** that crashes into the enemy tower, making it difficult to clear.
- A way to **force the enemy to respond**, as they must deal with the large wave or lose resources.

Slow pushing is effective when preparing for **objectives like Dragon or Rift Herald**, as the enemy will be occupied clearing the wave while you take control of the map.
